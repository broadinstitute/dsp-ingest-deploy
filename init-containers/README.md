# Init Containers

Sub-folders of this directory hold template configuration files for the
[Kubernetes Init Containers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers/)
used by Transporter components.

Each component also has a `Dockerfile` that is used to construct the init container image for
that component.
